# Performance benchmarking

Mosaic separates application CPU, HTTP latency, memory, and startup measurements
from isolated JMH operations and untimed batching diagnostics. The
[public performance page](../performance/README.md) presents the results; this
guide covers methodology, reproduction, and the complete published point tables.

## Application benchmarks

The separate `performance/` build compares equivalent optimized Kotlin and Mosaic
applications using the same Ktor server, models, serialization, and simulated
services. Direct Kotlin uses ordinary structured concurrency, explicit batching,
and request-scoped deduplication where appropriate. The [workload descriptions](../performance/README.md#workloads) explain
what each route does. Run application commands below from the repository root.

### Methodology

Each measured variant runs in a fresh JVM. Only one application runs at a time.
Pairs alternate order: direct then Mosaic, followed by Mosaic then direct.
Both variants receive the same JVM configuration and deterministic request input.
The authoritative JDK 21 configuration uses G1, `-Xms512m -Xmx512m`, and
`-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=12`, matching the twelve logical application CPUs.
One request body is prebuilt per run; inputs 1, 7, 42, and 99 rotate between
repetitions and remain identical within each pair.

Before measurement, a separate wrk2 run warms the same application JVM for
15 seconds using the same route, profile, offered rate, connections, and input.
Warmup must finish without HTTP/socket errors before the measured generator
starts calibration. Warmup CPU and requests are excluded from measurement.
`warmup_seconds` is recorded in configuration; use `--warmup-seconds` for a case.

wrk2 generates constant-rate POST traffic. The harness waits for every worker's
calibration-completion message before sampling application CPU and RSS from Linux
`/proc`. Measurement continues until wrk2 exits naturally. The default requests
30 seconds of measurement; the total generator duration includes its approximately
10-second calibration plus one second of margin. The actual post-calibration
window is recorded and must be between the requested duration and two seconds
longer. Startup and calibration CPU are excluded.

CPU/request uses the post-calibration completed-request count corresponding to
that measurement window, rather than the cumulative full-run count. A lightweight
Lua callback independently records dispatch counts and 100 ms bins in an interior
window starting 10.5 seconds after generator launch. Count fidelity, sub-second
pacing, socket errors, HTTP errors, and scheduling-latency anomalies are checked.
Invalid runs stop the suite and remain in the raw output; incomplete or invalid
pairs are excluded from comparisons. Each pair attempt is checkpointed durably.
Resume the same session with `--resume --output <existing-directory>` and the
original command/configuration. Completed valid pairs are retained; an invalid or
incomplete attempt reruns both variants in the original alternating order, in a
new attempt directory. No result is overwritten. Configuration, source, JDK, JVM,
generator, affinities, and host fingerprint must match before resuming. The first
complete valid attempt for each repetition supplies the summary; all attempts and
selected execution paths remain recorded in `pair-attempts.json`.

Primary **HTTP latency** measures actual request dispatch to response completion
(wrk2's uncorrected histogram). It is accepted only when the independent pacing
checks pass. **Scheduling latency** measures intended request schedule to response
completion (wrk2's corrected histogram) and is retained as a generator diagnostic.
It is not presented as application response latency.

Choose offered rates and connection counts appropriate to the workload and host.
Estimate concurrency from requests/second × response time in seconds, and leave
connection headroom. Passing pacing checks does not establish maximum application
capacity. CPU affinity is optional; by default processes inherit the caller's
affinity. Advanced options are documented by `--help`.

### Running application benchmarks

Requirements: Linux, Java 21, Python 3, and `wrk2` on PATH. The Linux utilities
`stdbuf` and, when requesting CPU affinity, `taskset` must also be available.
Run from a clean checkout. Application distributions are built by the harness.

```bash
./gradlew clean build -p performance

# Six pairs for one workload at a chosen offered rate.
python3 performance/benchmark/benchmark.py case \
  --route aggregate --profile service --rps 800 --repetitions 6

# Operational smoke validation, not a performance result.
python3 performance/benchmark/benchmark.py suite \
  --config performance/benchmark/config/smoke.json

python3 performance/benchmark/benchmark.py startup --samples 20
python3 -m unittest discover -s performance/benchmark/tests -v
```

The checked-in `performance/benchmark/config/authoritative.json` defines the
publication matrix: six pairs per point, 15s warmup, 30s measurement, four wrk2 threads, and
128 connections. Assign the application and generator affinities explicitly:

```bash
python3 performance/benchmark/benchmark.py --app-cpus 0-5,12-17 \
  --load-cpus 6-9,18-21 --output performance/results/authoritative suite \
  --config performance/benchmark/config/authoritative.json
# If interrupted/invalid: inspect raw evidence, then rerun the same command
# with --resume before the suite subcommand. Only incomplete/invalid pairs rerun.
```

For a larger matrix, copy the smoke JSON to an ignored file under
`performance/results/`, choose route/profile/rate lists, and set repetitions and
measurement duration. Use at least 30 seconds of measurement for performance
comparisons. Keep JVM settings, connection counts, and CPU work identical between
variants. Preserve whole physical cores when assigning separate affinities.

### Interpreting results

CPU cost is reported in milliseconds and microseconds per request. The primary
framework-cost measure is the paired Mosaic − direct overhead in **µs/request**.
HTTP and scheduling latency are in milliseconds, memory is in MiB, and startup
is in milliseconds. Peak RSS covers the measured window; `VmHWM` separately
records the process lifetime high-water mark.

Summaries show direct and Mosaic medians plus the median, minimum, maximum,
and interquartile range of paired differences in the metric's own units. The
interquartile range (IQR) describes the middle half of those differences.
A positive difference means Mosaic uses more CPU or memory, or has higher latency. For throughput, a positive
difference means more completed requests per second. Inspect individual pairs
and integrity warnings before interpreting a difference as repeatable.

Relative percentages can be misleading when the direct implementation itself uses
only a few hundredths of a millisecond of CPU. Public results therefore emphasize
absolute overhead per request.

wrk2's timing accuracy is approximately ±1 ms; small latency differences may be
below its resolution. Service delays can obscure response-time differences while
CPU/request still exposes orchestration cost. Compare results only when both
variants perform equivalent logical work, and report startup separately.

### Startup measurement

Startup measures process launch to the first successful `/health` response, using
20 alternating fresh-JVM pairs and a 5 ms readiness poll. It is measured separately
from warmed application execution.

### Metadata and raw output

Generated sessions contain the Git revision, JVM options, resolved generator
binary/version/hash, CPU affinity, kernel command line, clocksource, CPU topology,
scaling driver/governor and energy preference, microcode, idle driver, NixOS
version where available, request configuration, process samples, logs,
and JSON, CSV, and Markdown summaries. Results belong in the ignored
`performance/results/` directory.

Application distributions are fingerprinted by jar hashes, and metadata records
the actual Java executable/version, exact JVM options, affinities, and Git state.
Optional Linux/sysfs values are recorded where available without changing the
host. Generated raw sessions, process samples, execution commands, and pair-level
results remain ignored; the local handoff contains exhaustive execution evidence.

## JMH runtime benchmarks

Mosaic uses JMH for repeatable JVM timing and allocation measurements. The internal
`mosaic-benchmarks` module depends on `mosaic-core` and is neither published nor
included in the BOM. JMH handles warmup, measurement, forks, and JVM profiling;
the suite does not time operations with a clock in benchmark code.

The suite measures request Mosaic creation from an already-built Canvas, SingleTile
cold execution and completed `compose()` and `composeAsync()` cache hits, small CPU
tiles, graph width/depth/shared dependencies, MultiTile cold/half-cached/fully
cached requests, and Canvas lookup and layer creation.
Control methods help distinguish changes in the JVM or coroutine bridge from
changes in Mosaic. Fixtures are deterministic, and ordinary tests verify their
results, shared-leaf deduplication, and MultiTile cache states.

This is a micro/milli-benchmark suite for runtime costs. It does not measure an
application workload, databases, or network services. The separate
[`performance/`](../performance/README.md) build contains application-level
Mosaic versus handwritten Kotlin comparison workloads and published results.
Published operation timings come from JMH; application CPU and latency results
come from the separate comparison build. Neither suite defines regression thresholds.

### Developer profile

Use JDK 21 and run all benchmarks with:

```bash
./gradlew :mosaic-benchmarks:jmh
```

The defaults use average time in microseconds per operation, three one-second
warmup iterations, five one-second measurement iterations, and two forks. Results
are written to `mosaic-benchmarks/build/results/jmh/results.json`. The 0.7.3 Gradle
task does not expose arbitrary JMH command-line arguments. Build its executable
jar, then use JMH's ordinary CLI to filter or change a local exploratory run:

```bash
./gradlew :mosaic-benchmarks:jmhJar
java -jar mosaic-benchmarks/build/libs/mosaic-benchmarks-*-jmh.jar \
  '.*SingleTileBenchmark.*' -bm avgt -wi 3 -i 5 -w 1s -r 1s -f 2 \
  -tu us -rf json -rff mosaic-benchmarks/build/single-tile.json
```

### Authoritative timing profile

Keep the short defaults for developer iteration. Publication runs use one JMH
thread, average µs/op, 10 × 1s warmup, 10 × 1s measurement, and two forks:

```bash
./gradlew :mosaic-benchmarks:jmhJar
mkdir -p performance/results
taskset -c 0-5,12-17 java -jar mosaic-benchmarks/build/libs/mosaic-benchmarks-*-jmh.jar \
  -bm avgt -tu us -t 1 -wi 10 -i 10 -w 1s -r 1s -f 2 -foe true \
  -jvmArgs '-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=12' \
  -rf json -rff performance/results/jmh-timing.json
```

Use a new ignored output path. Record the exact jar/source revision, JDK, JVM
options, affinity, host fingerprint, and command alongside JSON. Inspect fork
and iteration variance as well as JMH's confidence interval. Do not profile the
canonical timing run; collect allocation evidence in a separate execution.

JMH's GC profiler reports allocation as `gc.alloc.rate.norm` in bytes per
operation:

```bash
java -jar mosaic-benchmarks/build/libs/mosaic-benchmarks-*-jmh.jar \
  '.*SingleTileBenchmark.completedCacheHitAsync' -bm avgt -wi 3 -i 5 -w 1s -r 1s -f 2 \
  -tu us -prof gc -rf json \
  -rff mosaic-benchmarks/build/cache-hit-async-gc.json
```

For publication allocation evidence, use the authoritative timing profile above
with `-prof gc` in a separate execution and a separate output file. The current
[operation and allocation results](../performance/README.md#isolated-jmh-operations)
identify the source revision and fixture boundaries.

The module's `check` task compiles benchmark sources without executing them.
Run `:mosaic-benchmarks:jmh` to verify JMH generation and execution. The full
suite is not part of normal PR validation.

### Fixture boundaries

Suspending benchmarks batch 32 actual operations inside one outer `runBlocking`
and use JMH `@OperationsPerInvocation(32)`. JMH therefore reports per-operation
time rather than per-batch time, while the entry bridge is amortized. The helper
does not supply a Mosaic request or coroutine scope; each benchmark decides when
to create those. Synchronous creation and lookup methods call the runtime
directly. The completed `composeAsync()` cache-hit benchmark directly returns the
cached `Deferred` without awaiting it. The direct and suspending controls reveal
some of the harness cost.

MultiTile request and cache setup occurs in JMH invocation setup so the timed
method always sees the stated cache state. For allocation profiling, JMH's GC
counter can also include allocations from invocation setup in its normalized
figure. Treat MultiTile allocation figures as workload-level diagnostics, not
isolated `compose` allocation costs. Cold SingleTile and graph benchmarks include
request creation, while MultiTile `cold`, `halfCached`, and `fullyCached` exclude
it from timing. A one-key request cannot be half cached, so the half-cached
variant begins at 16 keys.

`ExecutionDrainBenchmark` runs the four-branch shared diamond and four sibling
coalescing consumers with the same fixtures. After composing the root, it
completes and joins the request Job, waiting for every owned execution and attached
child. These measurements include execution cleanup after result publication;
compare them separately from the ordinary result-latency benchmarks. A fixture
test verifies that the drain waits for a child that outlives the published result.

Compare runs only on the same hardware, JDK, JVM options, and benchmark settings.
Hosted CI variance makes small percentage movements unsuitable as regression
signals. PR smoke selection, history, stable runners, and hard thresholds will
follow after baseline variance has been measured.

## Coalescing diagnostics

`coalescing` uses cyclic windows of 12 products with offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,
and 20 modulo 24, shifted by `catalogId * 1000`. Every reference contributes to
its section and the response total. Six stable sibling Tiles read the catalog
and request the same application-lifetime Products MultiTile independently;
the root only launches and awaits sections. Tracing stays off in measurements.

```bash
./gradlew :comparison-tests:batchDiagnostic -p performance
./gradlew :mosaic-benchmarks:coalescingDiagnostic
./gradlew :mosaic-benchmarks:coalescingDiagnostic --args="--serial"
./gradlew :mosaic-benchmarks:jmhJar
java -jar mosaic-benchmarks/build/libs/mosaic-benchmarks-*-jmh.jar '.*CoalescingBenchmark.*' \
  -bm avgt -tu us -wi 3 -i 5 -w 1s -r 1s -f 2
```

The permanent JMH fixture varies sibling fan-out (2/4/8/16) and extra Tile
dependencies separating later consumers from the first (0/1/2/5/10). Adjacent
branches overlap one of three keys; the two-branch case is ABC + CDE.
Diagnostics additionally cover external suspension. They verify every distinct
key is fetched once and report invocation counts and keys per invocation;
batch counts and deep-path coalescing are observations, not API guarantees.

The diagnostic defaults to the same `Dispatchers.Default` as JMH. `--serial`
uses one FIFO worker for reproducible discovery order; record the dispatcher
with the evidence. Default-dispatcher batch partitions may vary with scheduling.

### Observed graph behavior

Twenty graph samples per dispatcher also verified key completeness and uniqueness.
ABC + CDE and fan-out 2 combined into one call in all Default-dispatcher samples;
fan-out 4 took 1–2 calls, fan-out 8 took 2–5, and fan-out 16 took 5–8.
A serial FIFO dispatcher combined all same-depth fan-out cases into one call.
Depth 5, depth 10, and externally suspended consumers remained two calls with
both dispatchers. These are scheduling observations, not API guarantees.

## Dataset provenance

All current application, startup, JMH timing/allocation, and diagnostic results
were collected from clean revision
[`129b0c73864e82047e4f8e0b861aee31e4e9dc78`](https://github.com/Nick-Abbott/Mosaic/commit/129b0c73864e82047e4f8e0b861aee31e4e9dc78),
based on the merged coalescing runtime at `c6ed689`. Identify this dataset by
revision rather than assuming a published release version.

| Setting | Authoritative configuration |
| --- | --- |
| CPU / OS | AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, 12 physical cores / 24 threads; NixOS 26.05; Linux 7.2.7 |
| Java | Zulu JDK 21.0.11+10-LTS |
| JVM | `-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=12` |
| Application / JMH affinity | `0-5,12-17` (six whole physical cores / twelve logical CPUs) |
| Generator affinity | `6-9,18-21`; remaining physical cores available to the OS |
| wrk2 | 4.0.0-e0109df; SHA256 `8ea9a2225686179c62bf66c681f2c8a1e990da3450d1bc66c3c2fd98d44c01f7` |
| HTTP | Six pairs/point; 15s warmup; 30s requested measurement; four threads; 128 connections |

Pre-feature coalescing diagnostics used revision
`07a9eda5be3486ae6151dd35f43da129c3789401`.

The previous application/startup table came from
`f334a8661247eb219c21f8707b1af7b0c2f2a05a`, and the previous short MultiTile
measurements from `866ae0a9c90aec6f44864e8a9e47077d3bf33758`. The new dataset
changes explicit warmup, heap sizing, processor count, JDK/kernel environment,
repetition count, and JMH iteration lengths. Absolute changes from those older
figures cannot be attributed solely to Mosaic runtime changes. The earlier
Linux 7.0.0 environment exhibited severe timer instability; this dataset uses
Linux 7.2.7 and passed workload pacing qualification.

Generated raw sessions, fingerprints, artifact hashes, execution commands, and
pair-level results remain in the ignored `performance/results/` directory.
Measurements compare equivalent applications under the same conditions within
each pair; they do not measure maximum server capacity.

## Detailed result tables

All values below are unchanged from the published dataset. Application points
have six complete valid pairs. The primary number is the paired absolute CPU
difference; variant medians, ranges, and IQR show its context and variation.

### Application CPU results

| Workload/profile | RPS | Direct µs/request | Mosaic µs/request | Paired overhead µs/request | Paired min…max | Paired IQR |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| light/zero | 800 | 36.5 | 52.9 | +14.6 | 10.5…24.3 | 4.3 |
| light/zero | 1600 | 30.7 | 43.7 | +14.0 | 10.5…17.8 | 3.6 |
| light/service | 800 | 57.3 | 65.9 | +15.0 | 6.5…30.0 | 11.0 |
| batching/zero | 800 | 54.5 | 77.0 | +20.5 | 6.5…35.3 | 9.0 |
| batching/zero | 1600 | 45.4 | 63.6 | +19.1 | 15.2…21.9 | 4.5 |
| batching/service | 800 | 61.4 | 76.4 | +14.4 | 8.1…28.9 | 5.0 |
| aggregate/zero | 800 | 51.1 | 111.0 | +60.0 | 52.3…67.3 | 9.3 |
| aggregate/zero | 1600 | 40.3 | 89.7 | +48.2 | 42.6…59.2 | 4.7 |
| aggregate/service | 800 | 89.4 | 201.4 | +114.9 | 104.6…120.0 | 8.9 |
| aggregate/service | 1200 | 74.4 | 178.5 | +103.9 | 99.2…115.9 | 2.7 |
| coalescing/zero | 1600 | 37.2 | 98.8 | +61.3 | 57.6…66.1 | 3.1 |
| coalescing/service | 800 | 58.4 | 136.4 | +78.0 | 72.2…88.3 | 6.3 |
| compute/zero | 800 | 387.3 | 394.5 | +8.7 | -4.1…17.0 | 6.5 |
| compute/zero | 1600 | 365.8 | 371.2 | +6.2 | -9.3…17.9 | 6.1 |

All 168 runs formed complete valid pairs, with zero integrity warnings, socket
errors, or HTTP errors. No authoritative point required a retry or rate change.
Completed rates were 99.80–99.99% of offered load. A separate 6,400 RPS
`light/zero` qualification pair passed the stricter 100 ms pacing checks.

Per-request CPU generally falls at higher offered rates as fixed process costs
are amortized. Inspect individual pairs before interpreting a difference as
repeatable. The CPU-heavy control's individual differences straddle zero.

### HTTP latency results

These are medians of six run-level uncorrected HTTP percentiles, not percentiles
of a pooled distribution. Scheduling-corrected latency remains a separate
generator diagnostic.

| Workload/profile | RPS | Direct p50 / p95 / p99 ms | Mosaic p50 / p95 / p99 ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| compute/zero | 1600 | 0.113 / 0.175 / 0.227 | 0.111 / 0.169 / 0.220 |

### Process memory results

Values are medians of measured-window average RSS. Paired differences need not
match the subtraction of variant medians. Peak RSS covers the measured window;
`VmHWM` records the reported process-lifetime high-water mark.

| Workload/profile | RPS | Direct avg RSS MiB | Mosaic avg RSS MiB | Paired RSS difference MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| light/zero | 800 | 402.5 | 431.4 | +27.9 |
| light/zero | 1600 | 471.3 | 478.8 | +7.7 |
| light/service | 800 | 410.9 | 427.2 | +16.3 |
| batching/zero | 800 | 476.5 | 486.6 | +14.9 |

| aggregate/zero | 1600 | 472.8 | 476.5 | +6.0 |
| aggregate/service | 800 | 471.8 | 477.6 | +8.1 |
| aggregate/service | 1200 | 478.7 | 478.7 | -1.7 |

| coalescing/service | 800 | 469.2 | 476.7 | +5.6 |
| compute/zero | 800 | 448.0 | 447.3 | +4.3 |
| compute/zero | 1600 | 474.1 | 466.6 | -7.0 |

Two runs reported a sampled peak less than 2 MiB above the reported high-water
mark; both counters remain in the raw data as approximate observations.

### JMH operation results

Canonical timing used one thread, average µs/op, 10 × 1s warmup, 10 × 1s
measurement, and two forks, with no profiler.

| Operation / fixture | Mean µs/op | JMH 99.9% CI half-width µs |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Mosaic creation | 0.012134 | ±0.000010 |

| SingleTile completed compose | 0.005152 | ±0.000031 |
| SingleTile completed composeAsync | 0.001087 | ±0.000003 |
| MultiTile cold, 1 key | 3.3201 | ±0.0658 |
| MultiTile cold, 16 keys | 5.1665 | ±0.1331 |
| MultiTile fully cached, 1 key | 0.0744 | ±0.0023 |

| Shared diamond, size 4 | 5.6155 | ±0.0112 |
| Sibling coalescing, fan-out 4 / depth 0 | 7.8977 | ±0.0214 |

### Allocation results

These separate GC-profiler executions used the same iteration/fork profile.
Normalized values are rounded bytes/op; see the fixture boundaries above,
especially for invocation setup in MultiTile allocation measurements.

| Operation / fixture | Normalized allocation B/op |
| --- | ---: |
| Mosaic creation | 208.0 |
| SingleTile cold (includes request creation) | 818.8 |
| SingleTile completed compose | 8.3 |
| SingleTile completed composeAsync | 0.0 |
| MultiTile cold, 1 key (includes invocation setup) | 2271.5 |
| MultiTile cold, 16 keys (includes invocation setup) | 8021.9 |
| MultiTile fully cached, 1 key (includes invocation setup) | 2799.5 |
| MultiTile fully cached, 16 keys (includes invocation setup) | 10035.9 |
| Shared diamond, size 4 | 3467.5 |
| Sibling coalescing, fan-out 4 / depth 0 | 11459.1 |
