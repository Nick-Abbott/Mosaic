## How to Contribute
- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports or feature requests. Please include steps to reproduce bugs.
- **Pull Requests**: Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and submit a PR against `main`. Link PRs to an issue when possible.
- **Code Style**: Styling is enforced by ktlint. Use `./gradlew ktlintFormat` to auto-fix most issues. Keep commits small and descriptive.
- **Tests**: PRs must meet coverage requirements enforced by Kover. Add or update tests for any new functionality.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, imperative titles (e.g., "Add X" not "Added X").
