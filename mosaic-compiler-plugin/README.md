# Mosaic compiler extraction prototype

This published build-tooling module is a read-only Kotlin 2.2.10 K2 compiler plugin. It uses
`CompilerPluginRegistrar` and `IrGenerationExtension` before IR lowering. It
does not transform Kotlin or run Mosaic code. A separate full compiler invocation
emits one complete main-source-set summary; ordinary `compileKotlin` does not
produce the snapshot.

The supported extraction path covers public `Tile` and `MultiTile` creation,
reified, KClass, and CanvasKey lookup, `canvas`, `single`, `withLayer`, `paint`,
`create`, `compose`, and `composeAsync` in the tested shapes; immutable local
Canvas, Mosaic, Tile, and CanvasKey aliases; caller-side
argument evaluation in source order; parameterized Canvas helpers; ordinary
resolved calls and getters; and the direct final template method to protected
abstract suspend override transfer by parameter position. `multiTile` and
`perKeyTile` execution is classified for known-empty, known-nonempty, and unknown
requests; nested callbacks are not generally interpreted. Fresh local Tile
values get deferred body templates and invocation-local
allocation identities. Immutable aliases share the value; unsupported
capability-bearing captures are named unknown when the body executes.
Mutable and read-only List/Set/Map keys normalize to their shared runtime
KClass identity. A user
constructor is exported as a callable: proven Mosaic-free initialization has
empty effects, while capability-bearing initialization is unknown. Referenced
stored-property initialization is extracted through its getter or field read;
ordinary constants remain harmless. This does not model every JVM class-load
trigger or exception. Used capability-bearing defaults and defaults whose binary
body is unavailable are unknown after explicit actuals are evaluated. Mosaic
extension-helper receiver transfer is not modeled, so those calls are unknown;
direct Tile `source()` and direct `other.source()` remain supported. Regular
Mosaic parameters cannot borrow the caller's current Canvas. Property accessors
use the same receiver and inline safeguards as functions. Omitted constructor
defaults use the same conservative boundary as function defaults. Reified
generic array keys use erased JVM array class identity: `Array<String>` and
`Array<Int>` differ, while arrays of List element types match. Unknown Mosaic
receiver provenance, unsupported control flow, and capability callbacks also
produce explicit unknown effects. This is a narrow extractor, not a general
Kotlin interpreter.

Array component mapping is limited to boxed primitives, `String`, `Any`,
List/Set/Map/Collection interfaces, primitive arrays, and nested supported
arrays. An unrecognized generic array component produces an unknown key.

An external const qualifier arrives in this phase as a literal. Its value is
retained in the caller's summary. The original external const declaration is
not reliably recoverable, so the summary records a provenance limitation.
External inline helper bodies are unavailable before backend inlining; a helper
that can affect Mosaic is explicitly unknown. The extractor never substitutes
the newest helper body into an already compiled caller.

The plugin produces complete main-source-set metadata as deterministic UTF-8
JSON at `META-INF/mosaic-analysis/v1/summary.json` when packaged by the Gradle
plugin. The discovery path stays stable; the explicit header governs
compatibility. Format 3 uses `analysis-contract-2` semantics and Kotlin 2.2.10.
The producer version is `prototype-9`. Unpublished prototype-7 snapshots are
rejected and must be regenerated. The payload checksum covers the canonical
module, stable key exports, provenance limitations, and binary locators; it detects corruption,
not producer trust. See the analysis-core README for the wire format and
compatibility policy.

Only analysis-core applies the Kotlin serialization compiler plugin to generate
the serializers. The packaged compiler plugin includes the serialization
runtime through analysis-core; consuming projects do not apply that compiler
plugin. The compiler option names and symbol-locator strategy remain internal
and provisional. This module is resolved automatically by the same-version
Mosaic Gradle analysis plugin; it is not an application runtime dependency or
included in the BOM.

## Test placement

`mosaic-analysis-core` tests own semantic combinations. Compiler tests check
source-to-contract fidelity, while Gradle TestKit tests check wiring, packaging,
and invalidation. Put a regression's decisive assertion at the cheapest layer
that exposes it, and extend a relevant compiled fixture before adding another
compiler or build invocation. Retain distinct failure guarantees rather than
each historical test wrapper.

The [executable scenario index](src/test/SCENARIOS.md) fixes the supported
boundary and operation/context coverage. A single normalizer evaluates each IR
expression once, appends its effects, and returns an abstract value. Immutable
aliases read that value; Canvas computations initialize invocation-local slots.
Compiler temporaries preserve named-argument order, without source-offset sorting.
Functions, accessors, constructors and intrinsics all prepare receiver and actual
values before defaults and eligibility. Registration arguments run before eager
providers. Lambda/reference creation does not execute the body; unsupported
invocation or escape is explicitly unknown.

The kernel shares call activation, dispatch resolution, parameter binding and
continuation for ordinary and Canvas results. Only a continuing path delivers a
result; incomplete expansion and unknown behavior preserve continuation. The
small effect-free whitelist and structural proof do not exempt whole packages,
ordinary return types or unavailable bodies. Constructor delegation remains a
symbolic call; unsupported stored initialization stays a named boundary.

Ordinary calls and structural omission share the same eligibility decision.
Equality, hashing collection construction, and error-message conversion require
a scalar type proof (or a statically empty collection); otherwise they report a
localized implicit-callback boundary. Lists/arrays retain their callback-free
creation behavior. Bound references evaluate receivers, while lambda and
reference bodies remain deferred. This does not interpret arbitrary callbacks
or prove general exception safety.

DSL receivers bind the entry Canvas to invocation-local value references before
body evaluation. Captures retain that Canvas across nested builders/providers;
a provider's own receiver binds its construction layer without reconstructing it.
Stable Tile properties require a top-level immutable declaration with a default
getter and supported Tile initializer. Custom getters retain evaluated effects
but yield unknown Tile provenance. Binary references require a proven stable
Tile export from the selected producer summary; a top-level val alone is no proof.
