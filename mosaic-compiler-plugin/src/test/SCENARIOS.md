# Executable scenario index

Frozen before production edits. V = strict VERIFIED, M = exact missing key,
U = named UNVERIFIED boundary, D = deferred, R = rejected. Analysis concerns
selected-root Canvas availability, not general exceptions or deadlocks.
K names refer to analysis-core tests; C/B to compiler tests; G to TestKit.
`ExecutionCatalogTest` (EC) compiles one family and selects each named root.
`PublicApiCoverageTest` compiles one two-file family and selects public API roots;
`BinaryCanvasKeyExportTest` compiles one producer and one consumer. The
[public API matrix](PUBLIC_API_MATRIX.md) fixes support decisions and interactions.

Current production guarantee: reified, KClass, and CanvasKey forms share exact
runtime key identity for lookup, registration, and paint. Immutable top-level
CanvasKey values export explicit facts; unavailable binary exports and dynamic
key components stay named unknown. Mosaic.canvas carries its current Canvas.
Canvas layering, Tile creation, and compose/composeAsync retain evaluation order
and known-empty/known-nonempty/unknown MultiTile execution distinctions.

## Operation/context matrix

Each cell names the adapter or interaction, not a Cartesian-product build.
All call adapters must use receiver → supplied actuals → used defaults →
eligibility/target → execution → continuing result. IR temporaries carry order.

| Form | Discard | Initializer | Argument/receiver | Ordinary return | Canvas return |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Top-level/final | EC discard | EC aliases | IrShape actuals | IrShape helper | EC prefixes |
| Member | relay fixture | EC ordered receiver | enterprise template | enterprise handle | EC virtual method |
| Getter/setter | EC getters | stored property | receiver boundaries | initialization fixtures | EC virtual getter |
| Constructor | defaults fixture | stored domain | enterprise concrete receiver | domain construction | U for custom Canvas implementations; runtime Canvas constructor not public |
| Template/hook | slot fixture | ordinary call adapter | enterprise concrete receiver | enterprise response | same call adapter; arbitrary factory dispatch U |

Eligibility controls: direct V (enterprise/final); unsupported receiver U
(Mosaic extensions, virtual method/getter); inline U (ordinary/Canvas getter
and unchanged binary accessor); missing binary U (ordinary/constructor and
kernel Canvas reference). Defaults apply to functions/constructors only;
Kotlin accessors cannot declare optional parameters. Setters return Unit.
Immutable alias, expression/block return, consumed/discarded value, parameter
renaming, supplied/omitted defaults and source/binary equivalences retain the
same semantic expectations. Negative roots must reach the named operation.

Unsupported: arbitrary dispatch, Mosaic extension transfer, general defaults,
inline reconstruction, mutable/escaped provenance, lifecycle inference,
callbacks/delegates/reflection/complex control and complete JVM initialization.
Keep the final concrete receiver → inherited final template → direct protected
abstract suspend hook path strictly V with no assumptions.

Compiler facts exercised here: K2 represents named-argument reordering using IR
blocks/temporaries; external top-level declarations belong to package fragments,
not source files; unavailable binary defaults are error-expression stubs. Getter
bodies cannot suspend, so the Canvas getter prefix probe asserts its actual
UNVERIFIED Metrics lookup on an unknown returned Canvas, not an invented empty
Canvas or a generic root failure. Unknown ordinary Canvas-helper arguments are
no longer rejected solely for their type: their work runs through the same plan.
The former blanket rejection assertion was corrected; the known missing lookup
is still required, and harmless ordinary actuals can verify.

## Classifier audit (Kotlin 2.2.10, fixed before classifier edits)

Both ordinary normalization and structural omission must use the same operation
proof. Arguments/receivers execute before that proof; callable bodies do not
execute on reference creation. The following covers the whole existing whitelist
and every structural early-return category. New assertions share EC's compilation.

| Classifier category | Evidence / expected outcome and EC roots |
|---|---|
| `EQEQ` | May dispatch user `equals`: `structuralEquality` U (implicit equals), `conditionalEquality` U (control). Harmless constructors isolate dispatch. Primitive/String operand proof: `primitiveEquality`, `stringEquality`, existing `harmlessControl` V. |
| `setOf`, `mutableSetOf`, `mapOf`, `mutableMapOf` | Kotlin 2.2.10 stdlib bytecode populates sets/maps; element/key hashing/equality may call user code. `setCallbacks`, `mutableSetCallbacks`, `mapCallbacks`, `mutableMapCallbacks`, `opaqueSet` U (implicit hashCode/equals). Scalar elements/keys and statically empty inputs V: `safeCollections`, `safeMaps`, `safeSetSpread`. Map values require no hashing proof. |
| `error` | Stdlib bytecode invokes message `Object.toString`: `errorCallback` U (implicit toString); `errorConstant` V within Canvas-availability scope (general exceptions are excluded). |
| Any constructor, String toString, primitive operations | Exact built-ins only; final scalar implementations do not dispatch user callbacks. Existing domain/primitive controls V. No package-prefix exemption. |
| `less`, `greater`, `lessOrEqual`, `greaterOrEqual` | Compiler primitive comparison intrinsics; any preceding user `compareTo` is an evaluated child. Existing harmless loop/comparison V. |
| empty collections, lists, arrays, `System.nanoTime` | No element callbacks during creation/read; evaluated actual work retained. `safeCollections` V even with user-valued elements; existing receiver/named/vararg/spread order unchanged. |
| Constants/value reads | No evaluated children. Existing alias and ordering assertions unchanged. |
| Lambda creation | Body deferred: `unusedLambda`, `deferredCreation` V; invocation/escape assertions remain U. |
| Function reference creation | Inspect evaluated bound receivers/arguments only. Exact `boundReference(kotlin.Boolean)` U (control), `directBoundReference` M (Metrics construction). Unbound references in `deferredCreation` V; referenced bodies stay deferred. |
| Function access | Actuals, callable escape, used defaults, intrinsic eligibility, final/non-inline/body/recursion checks all required. An unproven implicit callback must not fall through to an empty body proof. Existing inline/default/invocation tests unchanged. |
| Field read / object read | Field receiver must be inspected, delegated/capability/unavailable initialization cannot prove harmless. `conditionalField` U, `directField` M; Unit singleton remains the only harmless object exemption. Existing object/delegate tests U. |
| Variable and field/value writes | Child work retained; mutable capability declarations and callable field escapes cannot bypass normalizer boundaries. `mutableAlias` and selected `CallbackField` setter U (control). |
| Instance initializer marker | Constructor adapter owns explicit stored initialization; marker is not independent proof of a harmless constructor. Existing initialization/super tests retained. |
| Blocks, returns, casts, branches, loops, varargs/spreads, throws | Recursively prove evaluated children; no unconditional flattening of unsupported paths. Exception interpretation remains outside scope. Existing control/default tests retained. |
| All remaining nodes | No structural proof: localized U. No arbitrary operator/collection callback analysis added. |

The field fixture records the compiler's actual access representation rather than
assuming `@JvmField` guarantees a raw field node at the pre-lowering phase.

Structural cross-checks `conditionalSet`, `conditionalMap`, `conditionalError`
are U for control flow with unproved callbacks; `conditionalScalars` is V.
`conditionalEquality` takes user-valued parameters so constructor eligibility
cannot mask the equality decision.

Call eligibility audit also covers reference-typed actuals (KFunction as well as
Function types) and Mosaic extension ownership: `conditionalReferenceEscape`
and `conditionalExtension` U (control), even when the final callee body is empty.
These share the normal call boundary checks rather than a separate body shortcut.

Frozen classifier run before production edits: Kotlin 2.2.10, 38 EC assertions,
16 failures (all incorrectly VERIFIED), 22 passing controls; one shared fixture
compilation. Both reviewed roots fail at their named assertions, not root lookup.

The C5 reference-escape assertion also checks an immutable alias typed as Any
(`conditionalReferenceAlias`): reading the resolved binding must retain its
callable fact without replaying initialization. This equivalence check exposed
a remaining structural omission during implementation (V before the alias-fact
fix); it now requires the same control-flow U as the direct reference.

Final focused run: all 38 assertions pass, including the alias equivalence.
Executed JUnit time was 2.272s before / 2.330s after, one compiler invocation
each (warm dependencies; single samples, not a speedup claim). The full root
gate retains 36 compiler invocations and 24 TestKit builds; no fixture added.

Receiver ownership and stable property regressions (same EC compilation):
`capturedEntry` / `capturedLabelEntry` require missing outer Metrics despite an
inner registration; `capturedSuppliedEntry` is V with the outer binding's site.
`capturedOnceEntry` checks one outer provider construction. `nestedFactoryMissing`
is M; `nestedFactorySupplied` is V and distinguishes the captured factory's
original layer from the nested provider's own paint layer. `directNeedsEntry`,
`directNeedsSupplied`, and `stableTileAlias` preserve direct source and alias M/V.
`computedEntry` is specifically U for computed Tile provenance, with no exported
initializer Tile contract. `computedWorkEntry` retains both getter and creation
lookups. The existing binary-default producer/consumer compilation also checks
stable Tile aliases V, custom getters without stable exports U, and loss of the
stable export U while retaining callable metadata; no additional builds.
Before production edits, Kotlin 2.2.10 executed 48 EC assertions (7 failed) and
2 existing default/binary assertions (1 failed). The failures expose incorrect
verification, inner-provider provenance, omitted getter work, and an optimistic
binary export. Direct source, stable aliases, creation work and construction-once
controls pass already; their expected outcomes remain unchanged.
After the ownership/export corrections, all 48 EC and both default/binary
assertions pass. The full compiler suite retains 36 compiler invocations.
