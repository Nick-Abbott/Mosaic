# Repository guide

Mosaic is a Kotlin framework for composable backend orchestration. The public
runtime API in `mosaic-core` and `mosaic-test` is independent of the optional
analysis tooling.

## Modules

- `mosaic-core`: runtime Canvas, Mosaic, Tile, and MultiTile APIs.
- `mosaic-test`: runtime tile testing support.
- `mosaic-opentelemetry`: optional execution tracing through OpenTelemetry.
- `mosaic-bom`: runtime dependency alignment.
- `mosaic-analysis-core`: contract model, codec, evaluator, and policy.
- `mosaic-compiler-plugin`: Kotlin IR to contract extraction.
- `mosaic-gradle-plugin`: optional build integration and verification.
- `examples`: separate Gradle build for Spring, Ktor, Micronaut, and shared tiles.

## Documentation skills

- For adoption-focused README/project docs and public summaries, read
  [public-docs](.agents/skills/public-docs/SKILL.md).
- For guides, reference, and explanations in `docs/` or module documentation, read
  [technical-docs](.agents/skills/technical-docs/SKILL.md). Route by reader purpose;
  use both when a change spans both audiences.

## Architecture skills

- When designing or materially restructuring a module, interface, or ownership
  model, especially foundational or public behavior, use
  [codebase-design](.agents/skills/codebase-design/SKILL.md).
- After a substantial feature/refactor is behaviorally correct, use
  [zero-tech-debt](.agents/skills/zero-tech-debt/SKILL.md) to check whether its
  final shape still reflects the historical route taken to get there.

Neither skill is required for routine edits or authorizes unrelated cleanup.

## Focused agent skills

- For reported bugs or performance regressions, use
  [diagnosing-bugs](.agents/skills/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md).
- When creating or materially editing guidance for coding agents, use
  [writing-for-agents](.agents/skills/writing-for-agents/SKILL.md).
- Only on explicit user request, use [retro](.agents/skills/retro/SKILL.md) for
  session/environment recommendations or
  [architecture-audit](.agents/skills/architecture-audit/SKILL.md) for architectural
  improvement opportunities. Both stop at recommendations without editing files.

## Analysis invariants

- Support exactly Kotlin compiler and Gradle plugin 2.4.20. Reject unsupported
  project configurations conservatively.
- Mosaic analysis runs inside normal `main` Kotlin compilation. Production
  builds launch no separate Mosaic compiler process.
- The compiler writes source-relative shards for affected files. Shards are
  internal state; packaged dependency metadata is one complete summary.
- `extractMosaicMain` only assembles current-source shards. It produces an
  explicit empty complete summary when Kotlin reports `NO_SOURCE`.
- Dependency summary invalidation is separate from source compilation.
- Incremental and clean builds must produce the same summary and verification
  result. Preserve the current unknown boundaries, metadata compatibility,
  publication behavior, and public API matrix.

## Tests and validation

Put evaluator, model, and codec semantics in `mosaic-analysis-core` tests; IR
to contract fidelity in `mosaic-compiler-plugin` tests; and wiring, incremental
build behavior, and publication in Gradle TestKit tests. Use the cheapest layer
that decisively proves a regression. Keep direct K2 compiler fixtures: they test
IR extraction even though production uses normal Kotlin compilation.

Tests are evergreen behavioral specifications, not proof that a code change
occurred. A production change does not inherently require a new test. Add or
retain tests for durable observable behavior, semantic invariants, supported
compatibility promises, or meaningful failure boundaries. Prefer tests that
remain meaningful if the implementation is replaced while preserving behavior.

Do not test implementation shape (method presence/absence, historical names,
modifiers, synthetic flags, file/class structure, or unsupported internal access)
merely because it changed. Negative API tests must protect an explicit supported
compatibility contract, not ban historical names or memorialize implementation
decisions.

Run before submitting:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew clean build -p examples
git diff --check
```

After staging all changes, run `git diff --cached --check` as a separate command
to include newly added files. Resolve any failures before committing or finalizing.

Use a sibling worktree for substantial changes. Do not modify another active
worktree or remove it; remove only the clean worktree created for your task.
