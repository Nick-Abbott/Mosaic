title: 'Own resources'
description: 'Give application and child Canvases explicit resource lifetimes.'
---

`Canvas` implements `AutoCloseable`. Layers that only bind values need no explicit closing. When a Canvas owns `AutoCloseable` bindings, call `close()`, use `use`, or arrange an equivalent application shutdown hook. Closing it closes its locally created `AutoCloseable` bindings, not parent resources. Close an application Canvas with owned resources at shutdown; scope child Canvases explicitly when they own resources. `withMosaic` cancels and joins unfinished Tile work on every exit; it does not close its Canvas for you. Local resources are closed in reverse successful creation order, including dependencies created early through `source`. Cleanup continues after close failures, reporting those failures to standard error.

If construction fails or is cancelled, successfully created local `AutoCloseable` bindings are closed in reverse creation order, including dependencies resolved early through `source`. Parent resources are left open. Cleanup failures are suppressed on the original construction failure. A constructor is responsible for resources it allocates before failing to return a value.

For build-time checks within supported boundaries, see the optional [analysis plugin](https://github.com/BuildMosaic/Mosaic/blob/main/mosaic-gradle-plugin/README.md). It can report proven missing bindings and unverifiable paths, not guarantee every dynamic lookup.

## Borrow externally owned instances

Register a pre-existing service with `instance(existingClient)`, `instance<Client>("primary", existingClient)`, or `instance(clientKey, existingClient)`. Canvas never closes these borrowed values, including on construction rollback. They are available to `source` during eager construction and use the same lookup, qualifier, duplicate-key, override, and parent-fallback rules as `provide` bindings.

Use `provide { HttpClient() }` when Canvas constructs and owns the client. The external owner remains responsible for closing an `instance` binding.

## Scope a child that owns resources

Keep the lifetime visible around composition:

```kotlin
suspend fun render(applicationCanvas: Canvas): String =
  applicationCanvas.withLayer {
    provide<LocalClient> { LocalClient() }
  }.use { requestCanvas ->
    requestCanvas.withMosaic { compose(ResponseTile) }
  }
```

This excerpt assumes your `LocalClient` implements `AutoCloseable`, your `ResponseTile` returns `String`, and the corresponding Canvas/withMosaic imports are present. `use` closes the child when composition returns or throws. It leaves application-owned services open.

At application startup, construct the parent Canvas. Register its `close()` with your framework's shutdown lifecycle if it owns resources. A plain request ID binding does not need a close scope.

Do not make resource lifetime depend on tracing completion: telemetry finalization can happen later without delaying the application's result.
