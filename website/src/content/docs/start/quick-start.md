description: 'Create a Tile, bind request input, and compose a response in a runnable Kotlin program.'
---

Build a small response from request input, then compose it with another Tile. This tutorial uses Kotlin/JVM, JDK 21, and Gradle. You do not need an HTTP server. If you already have a Kotlin project, add the [core dependency](/start/installation/) and start at the program below.

## Create the project

Add `settings.gradle.kts` with `rootProject.name = "mosaic-hello"`, then create this build file. The Kotlin version matches Mosaic's own build toolchain.

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
  kotlin("jvm") version "2.4.20"
  application
}

repositories { mavenCentral() }

dependencies {
  implementation("org.buildmosaic:mosaic-core:0.6.0")
}

kotlin { jvmToolchain(21) }
application { mainClass.set("MainKt") }
```

Use Gradle 8.14.4 or the wrapper in the Mosaic repository with JDK 21. The [compatibility page](/reference/compatibility/) distinguishes build and runtime requirements.

## Bind input and compose

Create `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt`:

```kotlin title="Main.kt"
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
import org.buildmosaic.core.singleTile
import org.buildmosaic.core.source
import org.buildmosaic.core.injection.CanvasKey
import org.buildmosaic.core.injection.canvas
import org.buildmosaic.core.injection.create

val UserIdKey = CanvasKey(String::class, "userId")
val GreetingTile by singleTile { "Hello, ${source(UserIdKey)}!" }

fun main() = runBlocking {
  val applicationCanvas = canvas {}
  val greeting = applicationCanvas.withLayer {
    single(UserIdKey) { "user-123" }
  }.create().compose(GreetingTile)
  println(greeting) // Hello, user-123!
}
```

Run `./gradlew run` if your project has a wrapper, or `gradle run`. The program prints `Hello, user-123!`.

The **Canvas** binds input under a typed key. `withLayer` adds request values without changing the application Canvas. `create()` makes a **Mosaic** with its own Tile cache. `compose(GreetingTile)` executes the Tile and suspends until its value is available. The Tile reads the input using `source`.

## Compose the response from Tiles

Keep the imports and greeting Tile, add a response model and two declarations, and replace `main` with this version:

```kotlin title="Main.kt (composition)"
data class WelcomeResponse(val greeting: String, val help: String)

val HelpTile by singleTile { "Your account is ready." }
val WelcomeTile by singleTile {
  val greeting = composeAsync(GreetingTile)
  val help = composeAsync(HelpTile)
  WelcomeResponse(greeting.await(), help.await())
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
  val applicationCanvas = canvas {}
  val response = applicationCanvas.withLayer {
    single(UserIdKey) { "user-123" }
  }.create().compose(WelcomeTile)
  println(response)
}
```

The result is `WelcomeResponse(greeting=Hello, user-123!, help=Your account is ready.)`. Both branches start before you await their values. Neither needs to know how the other works. If two branches ask for `GreetingTile`, they share its work within this Mosaic.

## Put it behind an endpoint

At the request boundary, add input to your application Canvas, create one Mosaic, and compose the response Tile from your suspending handler. Routing and HTTP errors remain in your framework. [Run the Spring Boot, Ktor, or Micronaut order example](/guides/frameworks/) to see a deeper graph in an application.

Request layers that only bind values need no explicit close. If a Canvas creates resources, give it an explicit [owner and close scope](/guides/resources/).

Continue with [Tiles and composition](/concepts/tiles/), or [test response logic](/guides/testing/) by replacing dependency Tiles.
