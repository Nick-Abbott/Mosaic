# Changelog

Significant user-facing changes to Mosaic are documented here. Earlier versions
predate this maintained changelog; their release history is not reconstructed here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Canvas-owned registration is `provide`, construction-time required lookup is
  `source`, and optional Canvas/Mosaic lookup is `sourceOrNull`. The former
  `single`, `paint`, and `sourceOr` names are removed without compatibility aliases.
  This intentionally breaks Kotlin source and JVM binary compatibility before 1.0;
  recompile consumers. Eager construction and resource ownership are unchanged.
- Reified Canvas `source<T>(qualifier)` and `sourceOrNull<T>(qualifier)` accept
  an optional qualifier, matching Mosaic lookup. Explicit CanvasKey and KClass
  lookups remain supported.
- Scoped execution is the sole supported lifecycle: remove `Canvas.create()` and
  public `MosaicImpl` construction/subclassing. Move handler calls inside
  `canvas.withMosaic { handler(this) }`; put dispatcher selection around that call.
- Replace `TestMosaicBuilder.build()` with suspending `withMosaic { ... }`.
  Use `mosaicBuilder()` or `TestMosaicBuilder()` without a stored TestScope.
  Test assertions and composition delegate to the production runtime, inheriting
  the caller's Job, dispatcher, scheduler, and other context elements. Every exit
  cancels unfinished producers and joins producer/attached-child cleanup.
- These removals intentionally break Kotlin source and JVM binary compatibility
  before 1.0. Recompile consumers. The public `Mosaic` interface remains supported.
- Compiler source extraction recognizes `withMosaic` as the execution boundary;
  serialized provenance semantics are unchanged.
- Construction-time lookup uses `LookupKind.CONSTRUCTION` and the serialized
  `CONSTRUCTION` tag. Analysis metadata moves to format 5; older dependency
  summaries are rejected with regeneration guidance. Analyzer semantics remain
  `analysis-contract-3`.

### Fixed

- Test Canvas sources use borrowed `instance` bindings and are never closed by
  Canvas. Callers retain ownership, including on failure.
- Test executions snapshot Tile substitutions, MultiTile substitutions, and Canvas
  sources before execution, with a fresh cache per invocation. Later builder
  changes affect only later executions, including nested custom substitutions.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- `Canvas.withMosaic` for one request lifetime: producer work inherits the calling
  coroutine; every exit cancels unfinished work and waits for cleanup.
- Typed, qualified, and CanvasKey `instance(...)` bindings for externally owned
  values that Canvas never closes, including on construction rollback. Qualifiers
  precede values, mirroring `single<T>("primary") { ... }`.
- Analysis recognition of supported `withMosaic` and `instance` usage, proven
  Tile-cycle detection, and configurable/suppressible recursive Tile/MultiTile
  policy with ERROR/WARNING/OFF severities. Proven cycles cannot be disabled.

### Changed

- MultiTile retains one terminal outcome per equal key. Per-key and chunk
  failures preserve successful siblings; strict bulk `compose` still throws on
  any requested failure. Returned Deferreds remain Mosaic-owned shared work.
- Analysis metadata moves to format 4 / `analysis-contract-3`; dependency
  summaries must be rebuilt with matching 0.7 tooling. Optional analysis still
  supports exactly Kotlin compiler/Gradle plugin 2.4.20.
- Spring, Ktor, and Micronaut examples use named Tiles, Canvas-supplied services,
  borrowed instances, child request Canvases, and suspending scoped handlers.

### Deprecated

- `Canvas.create()` at WARNING level. Move the complete handler invocation into
  `withMosaic` rather than retaining a Mosaic across requests.

### Fixed

- Present nullable MultiTile values succeed; omitted requested keys fail
  individually without discarding present values.
- Per-key and chunk provider failures no longer discard successful sibling keys.
- Tile body and attached-child failures use the same containment boundary with
  and without execution observation.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Delegated Tile naming with `val OrderTile by singleTile { ... }` and equivalent
  MultiTile factories. Aliases preserve the first name and the same cache identity.
- Supported execution observation for actual Tile executions and MultiTile batches,
  including caller context, shared-work relationships, and sanitized completion.
  Observation failures are isolated from Tile results.
- Optional `mosaic-opentelemetry` module and Canvas `tracing()` / `tracing { openTelemetry }`
  DSL. Spans use delegated Tile names, propagate coroutine context, and link shared work.
  The runtime BOM aligns the adapter alongside core and test libraries.

### Changed

- Canvas is a final Mosaic-owned class built with `canvas` or `withLayer`.
  External Canvas implementations and `MosaicCanvas` are removed; migrate to the DSL.
- Canvas construction shares concurrent dependency resolution, detects cycles, and
  cleans up local resources on failure/cancellation in reverse creation order.
- Kotlin compiler and Gradle plugin move to 2.4.20 with language/API level 2.4;
  runtime dependencies use stdlib 2.4.20 and coroutines 1.11.0. Runtime consumers
  require Kotlin 2.3.0 or later; JVM 17 remains the runtime target.
- Optional analysis supports exactly Kotlin compiler/Gradle plugin 2.4.20 and
  recognizes supported Mosaic-owned delegated Tile declarations. Older compiler
  summaries must be regenerated.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- MultiTile opportunistically combines newly pending uncached keys for the same
  MultiTile within a request Mosaic before scheduled execution begins. Ready work
  is not intentionally delayed; exact batch boundaries depend on scheduling.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Automatic discovery of safe application analysis roots from selected contracts,
  including local and dependency template/framework paths specialized for
  application receivers.
- `mosaicGraph` generates Markdown and Mermaid diagrams for local contracts,
  relevant dependencies, and application root findings.

### Changed

- Application roots are optional; explicitly configured roots replace automatic
  selection exactly.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Optional static Canvas contract analysis for supported Kotlin/JVM applications
  through the `org.buildmosaic.analysis` Gradle plugin.
- `APPLICATION` analysis roots and `LIBRARY` contract export. Published library
  contracts can be checked when an application consumes them.
- `STANDARD` enforcement, which warns on unverifiable paths, and `STRICT`
  enforcement, which also fails on those paths. Both fail proven missing Canvas
  requirements.
- Same-version analysis support and compiler artifacts for the Gradle plugin to
  resolve automatically.

### Changed

- Analysis extracts contracts incrementally during normal Kotlin compilation;
  production builds do not launch a second Mosaic compiler process.
- Mosaic runtime use no longer requires the old Mosaic registration plugins or
  KSP processors. The runtime BOM continues to align `mosaic-core` and
  `mosaic-test`.
- Low-level dependency-provider and analysis-extractor implementation types are
  no longer part of the Kotlin source API.

### Fixed

- Child Canvas construction can resolve bindings from its parent Canvas.
- Concurrent tile composition shares cached and in-flight results safely.
- Published runtime and test dependencies expose the coroutine libraries needed
  to compile against their public APIs.

### Analysis limits

Analysis is optional and currently supports Kotlin/JVM **2.2.10 only** within
the [documented pure `main` project boundary](mosaic-gradle-plugin/README.md#supported-project-boundary).
