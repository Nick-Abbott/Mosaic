# Mosaic OpenTelemetry

See which Tile work actually ran, which callers shared it, and which calls formed
a MultiTile batch. `mosaic-opentelemetry` adds execution spans to your application's
existing OpenTelemetry traces.

## Setup

Add the adapter to your Kotlin/JVM application:

```kotlin
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation("org.buildmosaic:mosaic-opentelemetry:0.6.0")
}
```

Use the same Mosaic version across runtime modules. With the
[BOM](../mosaic-bom/README.md), omit the adapter's dependency version.

The adapter includes Mosaic core and OpenTelemetry API 1.66.0. Your application
supplies the SDK or Java agent, sampling policy, processors, exporters, resources,
and shutdown. Mosaic neither installs an SDK nor registers global telemetry.
Provider callbacks run synchronously and must return promptly. Use an asynchronous
export path, normally the SDK's `BatchSpanProcessor`, for network exporters; Mosaic
does not create an export worker or make blocking exporters asynchronous.

## Configure tracing

Configure it once on your application Canvas. `openTelemetry` below is your
application's configured `OpenTelemetry` instance:

```kotlin
import org.buildmosaic.core.injection.canvas
import org.buildmosaic.core.injection.create
import org.buildmosaic.opentelemetry.tracing

val applicationCanvas = canvas {
  tracing { openTelemetry }
  single<OrderService> { orderService }
}

val requestCanvas = applicationCanvas.withLayer {
  single(OrderKey) { orderId }
}
val page = requestCanvas.create().compose(OrderPageTile)
```

Child Canvases inherit tracing. The provider factory runs once during Canvas
setup; a duplicate installation fails before another factory executes. Each
request Mosaic still owns its own cache and execution state. Closing a Canvas
does not shut down your telemetry pipeline.

With an already registered global provider, including an OpenTelemetry Java agent:

```kotlin
val applicationCanvas = canvas {
  tracing()
}
```

`tracing()` fails at setup if no tracing provider is registered, with guidance to
configure one. It does not initialize or freeze a global fallback. Use the explicit
factory to bypass global discovery; explicitly supplied no-op providers are accepted.

## What the spans represent

| Mosaic work | OpenTelemetry behavior |
| --- | --- |
| An actual SingleTile execution | One `INTERNAL` span named after the delegated Tile, or `Mosaic single` |
| An actual MultiTile batch | One `INTERNAL` span named after the delegated MultiTile, or `Mosaic multi`, with batch size |
| Initiating caller | Its captured OpenTelemetry context becomes the parent |
| Additional retained batch callers | Distinct contributor span links, available at creation for sampling |
| Composed producer, including cached work | A dependency link to its actual execution identity |
| Unresolved producer | A subscription adds the dependency link when its identity becomes available |

Use `val OrderTile by singleTile { ... }` to give executions a useful name. Names
are labels, not cache identities; aliases preserve the first bound name. Ordinary
`=` declarations use the generic fallback until delegated.

Repeated cache reads create no new spans. Multiple reservation groups produced
by one batch link to that same batch span. Relationships deduplicate by trace ID
and span ID; a contributor target also seen as a dependency keeps its first link.
Valid unsampled executions propagate their own identity. A no-op span that borrows
its parent's identity does not masquerade as a new producer.

Execution spans remain current throughout the execution scope, including attached
child coroutines, suspension, and dispatcher changes. They preserve captured
OpenTelemetry context, including baggage, and restore the preceding context.
They work with the official OpenTelemetry Kotlin coroutine context element at
the surrounding request boundary. Propagate your server context into the calling
coroutine using your framework's integration or OpenTelemetry's
`Context.asContextElement()`; declare `opentelemetry-extension-kotlin` directly if
your application uses that extension. Ordinary OpenTelemetry instrumentation inside
Tiles can use `Span.current()` and create downstream spans normally.

## Completion and retention

Span start and end timestamps describe Mosaic's actual execution scope. Results
may publish before attached children finish; a later child failure affects the
execution span without replacing an already published result. Unresolved
dependencies can delay telemetry finalization, but do not delay application
completion. When finalized later, the span ends at the recorded execution
completion time. Export remains the application's responsibility.

Mosaic retains the initiating caller and at most 63 additional batch callers,
while preserving exact contributor count and all work. The adapter retains at
most 64 distinct dependency links and 64 unresolved producer subscriptions per
recording span. Across one tracing installation, at most 1,024 unresolved
subscriptions can exist, including completed spans awaiting producers. Overflow
drops telemetry relationships, never application work, and sets
`mosaic.dependencies.truncated`. Contributor truncation is separately exposed as
`mosaic.contributors.truncated`; `mosaic.contributors.count` remains exact.
Non-recording spans retain no dependency collections or subscriptions.

Known contributor links are visible to sampling; dependency links added after
span creation cannot influence the original sampling decision. Your SDK's span
limits can further restrict exported links.

## Privacy and failure behavior

Span names include delegated property names when available. Choose static names
that contain no sensitive information. Automatic attributes contain execution kind, batch size, contributor counts, and
truncation flags. Failures set `ERROR` and optional `error.type` with the exception
class name. Cancellation sets `mosaic.execution.cancelled` and leaves status unset.
Mosaic never calls `recordException` or records keys, results, Canvas values,
request/user identifiers, exception messages, stacks, causes, or suppressed errors.

Application instrumentation and the existing parent context may contain information
your application deliberately supplies; those remain your application's privacy
responsibility. SDK/provider callback failures are isolated from Tile results and
reported using only callback category and exception class. A provider that throws
before returning a newly created span owns cleanup of any partial internal state.
